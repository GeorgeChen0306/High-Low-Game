<h1>High Low Game<h1>
<h2>Assignment Description</h2>
<p>This program will implement a simple high-low game where the player will arbitrarily guess what the actual number is via SMS. When the guessed number is too high, it will notify the user. Similarly, in the case of a lower number. When the player guesses the actual number, it will notify the user that they won, how many times they played, and ask them if they want to play a new game. The response must be yes or no (case insensitive).</p>

<h2>Program instruction</h2>
Run the program with "node index.js" so the user can send SMS to (708)-876-2276 (this will not work since the webhook ngrok will have expired by then) and it will respond to the message.
